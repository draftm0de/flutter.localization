# DraftMode Localization Facade

This facade exposes the generated `DraftModeLocalizations` bundle so apps can depend on the stable `package:draftmode_localization/localizations.dart` entry point.

- [`draftmode_localization`](https://github.com/draftm0de/flutter.localization) — Source ARB files and `flutter gen-l10n` configuration that produce the `DraftModeLocalizations` delegate consumed by DraftMode apps.
